\begin{theorem}

    \marginnote{This is a margin note using the \texttt{kaobook} class.}
    Let $f: \R^n \to \R^n$ be a continuous function. If $f$ is
    contractive, then $f$ has a unique fixed point.
\end{theorem}
Let us see how the typeset complexity classes look: $\P$, $\NP$, $\PSPACE$.

Also a citation
\sidecite{hollender_structural_2021} will look like this.

This is a test of how the \texttt{kaobook} class handles the the command
\textsc{scshape}.
