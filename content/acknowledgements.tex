\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I still recall my first day at ETH, some six years ago. I was seventeen, had very little idea what would await me, and was quite nervous. I spoke broken german, and had no idea what to expect from university life. The first year was tough, particular finding the pace in the first weeks.

I would first and foremost like to thank my supervisor Sebastian for his guidance and support throughout the project. He guided me through the complex and sometimes very subtle \TFNP\ landscape and was always available for a chat or a meeting. His input, and the many discussions we had, were invaluable to the project. I would also like to thank Professor Gärtner for the oppurtunity to work on this project in his group.
