\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

This thesis investigated the \Tarski\ problem and its position within the broader context of total search problems, specifically in the \TFNP\ complexity class. We began by summarizing the established results that position Tarski within PLS and ${\P}^{\PPAD}$. Following this, we introduced a new variant, \Tarskistar, to which the original \Tarski\ problem Turing-reduces. We demonstrated that this new problem reduces to \EndOfLine\ by applying Sperner's Lemma, deviating from the classical approach that relies on Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. This included a complete proof showing that \Sperner\ reduces to \EndOfLine\ thus showing it belongs to \PPAD\@.

Our goal was to understand why \Tarski\ is situated within \EOPL\ and to construct a reduction from \Tarski\ to the \EndOfPotentialLine\ problem. We discussed the challenges of linking existing results to accomplish this and proposed an alternative approach. By analyzing the structure of Tarski instances, particularly regarding the coloring of the lattice, we identified potential pathways for future research aimed at finding a direct reduction from \Tarski\ to \EndOfPotentialLine. We did not ultimately achieve a direct reduction but think that working with colored lattices, it a promising idea. We also strongly believe that the goal should be to find a many-to-one reduction from \Tarskistar\ to \EndOfPotentialLine\@, which would give us a better understanding of the problem.
