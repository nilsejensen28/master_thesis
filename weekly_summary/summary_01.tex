\section*{Past Week}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Read the first three chapters of:
          \textit{\citetitle{hollender_structural_2021} from
              \citeauthor{hollender_structural_2021}}
          This gave a good introduction into the definition of the different
          complexity classes, in particular \TFNP, \PPAD, \PLS\ and \EOPL.
    \item Also read the relevant parts of:
          \textit{\citetitle{etessami_tarskis_2020} from
              \citeauthor{etessami_tarskis_2020}}
          This gave an introduction of the \Tarski\ problem and in particular
          the proofs of the membership in \PLS\ and the idea of the membership
          in $\P^{\PPAD} = \PPAD$. In particular I played around with the
          reduction onto the \PLS\ class, and tried the naive approach of using
          this
          reduction to reduce the problem to the \EOPL\ class.
          $\P^{\PPAD}$.
    \item Skimmed over the paper \textit{\citetitle{buss_propositional_2012}
              from
              \citeauthor{buss_propositional_2012}}, seems rather difficult but
          the proof of $\P^{\PPAD} = \PPAD$ might be general enough to be used
          on the
          \EOPL\ class.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Ideas for the next week}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Read \textit{\citetitle{buss_propositional_2012} from
              \citeauthor{buss_propositional_2012}} in more detail, and in
          particular try to understand the proof of $\P^{\PPAD} = \PPAD$, and
          see if it
          can be applied to the \EOPL\ class, i.e. does it hold that $P^{\EOPL}
              = \EOPL$?
    \item Try to find a reduction from \Tarski\ to $\P^{\EOPL} = \EOPL$, which
          should be easier.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Administrative Points}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the expectations from your side?
    \item How often should we meet? When will Prof.\ GÃ¤rtner be
          available?
    \item Will there be a final presentation?
    \item How spontaneously are you available for questions?
    \item Problems with my Legi.
\end{itemize}
