	abstract = {Total {NP} search problems ({TFNP} problems) typically have their totality guaranteed by some combinatorial property. This paper proves that, if there is a polynomial time Turing reduction between two {TFNP} problems, then there are quasipolynomial size, polylogarithmic height, constant depth, free-cut free propositional (Frege) proofs of the combinatorial property associated with the first {TFNP} problem from the property associated with the second problem. In addition, they have Nullstellensatz derivations of polylogarithmic degree. These results extend the previous work of Buresh-Oppenheim and Morioka first by applying to Turing reductions in place of many-one reductions and second by giving tight bounds on the height of the Frege proofs. As a corollary, {PLScomplete} problems are not polynomial time Turing reducible to {PPA} problems relative to a generic oracle. We establish a converse construction as well, by showing that a polynomial time Turing reduction can be obtained from a family of quasipolynomial size, polylogarithmic depth, propositional proofs which are based on ‘‘decision tree’’ substitutions. This establishes the optimality of our constructions, and partially resolves an open question posed by Buresh-Oppenheim and Morioka.},

	abstract = {The use of monotonicity and Tarski’s theorem in existence proofs of equilibria is very widespread in economics, while Tarski’s theorem is also often used for similar purposes in the context of veriﬁcation. However, there has been relatively little in the way of analysis of the complexity of ﬁnding the ﬁxed points and equilibria guaranteed by this result. We study a computational formalism based on monotone functions on the d-dimensional grid with sides of length N , and their ﬁxed points, as well as the closely connected subject of supermodular games and their equilibria. It is known that ﬁnding some (any) ﬁxed point of a monotone function can be done in time logd N , and we show it requires at least log2 N function evaluations already on the 2-dimensional grid, even for randomized algorithms. We show that the general Tarski problem of ﬁnding some ﬁxed point, when the monotone function is given succinctly (by a boolean circuit), is in the class {PLS} of problems solvable by local search and, rather surprisingly, also in the class {PPAD}. Finding the greatest or least ﬁxed point guaranteed by Tarski’s theorem, however, requires d · N steps, and is {NP}-hard in the white box model. For supermodular games, we show that ﬁnding an equilibrium in such games is essentially computationally equivalent to the Tarski problem, and ﬁnding the maximum or minimum equilibrium is similarly harder. Interestingly, two-player supermodular games where the strategy space of one player is one-dimensional can be solved in O(log N ) steps. We also show that computing (approximating) the value of Condon’s (Shapley’s) stochastic games reduces to the Tarski problem. An important open problem highlighted by this work is proving a Ω(logd N ) lower bound for small ﬁxed dimension d ≥ 3.},

From the citation on the occasion of the 2018 "Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition" "... It is almost impossible to write a mathematics book that can be read and enjoyed by people of all levels and backgrounds, yet Aigner and Ziegler accomplish this feat of exposition with virtuoso style. [...] This book does an invaluable service to mathematics, by illustrating for non-mathematicians what it is that mathematicians mean when they speak about beauty." From the Reviews "... Inside {PFTB} (Proofs from The Book) is indeed a glimpse of mathematical heaven, where clever insights and beautiful ideas combine in astonishing and glorious ways. There is vast wealth within its pages, one gem after another... Aigner and Ziegler... write: "... all we offer is the examples that we have selected, hoping that our readers will share our enthusiasm about brilliant ideas, clever insights and wonderful observations." I do... " Notices of the {AMS}, August 1999 "... This book is a pleasure to hold and to look at: ample margins, nice photos, instructive pictures and beautiful drawings ... It is a pleasure to read as well: the style is clear and entertaining, the level is close to elementary, the necessary background is given separately and the proofs are brilliant..." {LMS} Newsletter, January 1999 "Martin Aigner and Günter Ziegler succeeded admirably in putting together a broad collection of theorems and their proofs that would undoubtedly be in the Book of Erdös. The theorems are so fundamental, their proofs so elegant and the remaining open questions so intriguing that every mathematician, regardless of speciality, can benefit from reading this book...

Gallai in 1969 concerning criticality in Sperner's lemma, listed as Problem 9.14 in the collection of Jensen and Toft [Graph coloring problems, John Wiley \& Sons, Inc., New York, 1995]. Sperner's lemma states that if a labelling of the vertices of a triangulation of the \$d\$-simplex \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}d\$ with labels \$1, 2, {\textbackslash}ldots, d+1\$ has the property that (i) each vertex of \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}d\$ receives a distinct label, and (ii) any vertex lying in a face of \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}d\$ has the same label as one of the vertices of that face, then there exists a rainbow facet (a facet whose vertices have pairwise distinct labels). For \$d{\textbackslash}leq 2\$, it is not difficult to show that for every facet \${\textbackslash}sigma\$, there exists a labelling with the above properties where \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ is the unique rainbow facet. For every \$d{\textbackslash}geq 3\$, however, we construct an infinite family of examples where this is not the case, which implies the answer to Gallai's question as a corollary. The construction is based on the properties of a \$4\$-polytope which had been used earlier to disprove a claim of T. S. Motzkin on neighbourly polytopes.},

In both models, we find the first polynomial time algorithm for finding a Tarski's fixed point. In addition, we provide a matching oracle bound for determining the uniqueness in the oracle function model and prove it is Co-{NP} hard in the polynomial function model. The existence of the pure Nash equilibrium in supermodular games is proved by Tarski's fixed point theorem. Exploring the difference between supermodular games and Tarski's fixed point, we also develop the computational results for finding one pure Nash equilibrium and determining the uniqueness of the equilibrium in supermodular games.},

	abstract = {Folklore in complexity theory suspects that circuit lower bounds against {NC}¹ or P/poly, currently out of reach, are a necessary step towards proving strong proof complexity lower bounds for systems like Frege or Extended Frege. Establishing such a connection formally, however, is already daunting, as it would imply the breakthrough separation {NEXP} ⊈ P/poly, as recently observed by Pich and Santhanam [Pich and Santhanam, 2023]. 
We show such a connection conditionally for the Implicit Extended Frege proof system ({iEF}) introduced by Krajíček [Krajíček, 2004], capable of formalizing most of contemporary complexity theory. In particular, we show that if {iEF} proves efficiently the standard derandomization assumption that a concrete Boolean function is hard on average for subexponential-size circuits, then any superpolynomial lower bound on the length of {iEF} proofs implies \#P ⊈ {FP}/poly (which would in turn imply, for example, {PSPACE} ⊈ P/poly). Our proof exploits the formalization inside {iEF} of the soundness of the sum-check protocol of Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, and Nisan [Lund et al., 1992]. This has consequences for the self-provability of circuit upper bounds in {iEF}. Interestingly, further improving our result seems to require progress in constructing interactive proof systems with more efficient provers.},
