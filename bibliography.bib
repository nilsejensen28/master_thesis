	abstract     = {Total {NP} search problems ({TFNP} problems) typically have their totality guaranteed by some combinatorial property. This paper proves that, if there is a polynomial time Turing reduction between two {TFNP} problems, then there are quasipolynomial size, polylogarithmic height, constant depth, free-cut free propositional (Frege) proofs of the combinatorial property associated with the first {TFNP} problem from the property associated with the second problem. In addition, they have Nullstellensatz derivations of polylogarithmic degree. These results extend the previous work of Buresh-Oppenheim and Morioka first by applying to Turing reductions in place of many-one reductions and second by giving tight bounds on the height of the Frege proofs. As a corollary, {PLScomplete} problems are not polynomial time Turing reducible to {PPA} problems relative to a generic oracle. We establish a converse construction as well, by showing that a polynomial time Turing reduction can be obtained from a family of quasipolynomial size, polylogarithmic depth, propositional proofs which are based on ``decision tree'' substitutions. This establishes the optimality of our constructions, and partially resolves an open question posed by Buresh-Oppenheim and Morioka.},

	abstract     = {The use of monotonicity and Tarski's theorem in existence proofs of equilibria is very widespread in economics, while Tarski's theorem is also often used for similar purposes in the context of verification. However, there has been relatively little in the way of analysis of the complexity of finding the fixed points and equilibria guaranteed by this result. We study a computational formalism based on monotone functions on the d-dimensional grid with sides of length N , and their fixed points, as well as the closely connected subject of supermodular games and their equilibria. It is known that finding some (any) fixed point of a monotone function can be done in time logd N , and we show it requires at least log2 N function evaluations already on the 2-dimensional grid, even for randomized algorithms. We show that the general Tarski problem of finding some fixed point, when the monotone function is given succinctly (by a boolean circuit), is in the class {PLS} of problems solvable by local search and, rather surprisingly, also in the class {PPAD}. Finding the greatest or least fixed point guaranteed by Tarski's theorem, however, requires d \cdot{} N steps, and is {NP}-hard in the white box model. For supermodular games, we show that finding an equilibrium in such games is essentially computationally equivalent to the Tarski problem, and finding the maximum or minimum equilibrium is similarly harder. Interestingly, two-player supermodular games where the strategy space of one player is one-dimensional can be solved in O(log N ) steps. We also show that computing (approximating) the value of Condon's (Shapley's) stochastic games reduces to the Tarski problem. An important open problem highlighted by this work is proving a \ensuremath{\Omega}(logd N ) lower bound for small fixed dimension d \geq{} 3.},

	abstract     = {The use of monotonicity and Tarski's theorem in existence proofs of equilibria is very widespread in economics, while Tarski's theorem is also often used for similar purposes in the context of verification. However, there has been relatively little in the way of analysis of the complexity of finding the fixed points and equilibria guaranteed by this result. We study a computational formalism based on monotone functions on the \$d\$-dimensional grid with sides of length \$N\$, and their fixed points, as well as the closely connected subject of supermodular games and their equilibria. It is known that finding some (any) fixed point of a monotone function can be done in time \${\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}d N\$, and we show it requires at least \${\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}2 N\$ function evaluations already on the 2-dimensional grid, even for randomized algorithms. We show that the general Tarski problem of finding some fixed point, when the monotone function is given succinctly (by a boolean circuit), is in the class {PLS} of problems solvable by local search and, rather surprisingly, also in the class {PPAD}. Finding the greatest or least fixed point guaranteed by Tarski's theorem, however, requires \$d{\textbackslash}cdot N\$ steps, and is {NP}-hard in the white box model. For supermodular games, we show that finding an equilibrium in such games is essentially computationally equivalent to the Tarski problem, and finding the maximum or minimum equilibrium is similarly harder. Interestingly, two-player supermodular games where the strategy space of one player is one-dimensional can be solved in \$O({\textbackslash}log N)\$ steps. We also observe that computing (approximating) the value of Condon's (Shapley's) stochastic games reduces to the Tarski problem. An important open problem highlighted by this work is proving a \${\textbackslash}Omega({\textbackslash}log{\textasciicircum}d N)\$ lower bound for small fixed dimension \$d {\textbackslash}geq 3\$.},

It is almost impossible to write a mathematics book that can be read and enjoyed by people of all levels and backgrounds, yet Aigner and Ziegler accomplish this feat of exposition with virtuoso style.

Inside {PFTB} (Proofs from The Book) is indeed a glimpse of mathematical heaven, where clever insights and beautiful ideas combine in astonishing and glorious ways. There is vast wealth within its pages, one gem after another...

I do... " Notices of the {AMS}, August 1999 "... This book is a pleasure to hold and to look at: ample margins, nice photos, instructive pictures and beautiful drawings ...

Gallai in 1969 concerning criticality in Sperner's lemma, listed as Problem 9.14 in the collection of Jensen and Toft [Graph coloring problems, John Wiley \& Sons, Inc., New York, 1995]. Sperner's lemma states that if a labelling of the vertices of a triangulation of the \$d\$-simplex \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}d\$ with labels \$1, 2, {\textbackslash}ldots, d+1\$ has the property that (i) each vertex of \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}d\$ receives a distinct label, and (ii) any vertex lying in a face of \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textasciicircum}d\$ has the same label as one of the vertices of that face, then there exists a rainbow facet (a facet whose vertices have pairwise distinct labels). For \$d{\textbackslash}leq 2\$, it is not difficult to show that for every facet \${\textbackslash}sigma\$, there exists a labelling with the above properties where \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ is the unique rainbow facet. For every \$d{\textbackslash}geq 3\$, however, we construct an infinite family of examples where this is not the case, which implies the answer to Gallai's question as a corollary. The construction is based on the properties of a \$4\$-polytope which had been used earlier to disprove a claim of T. S. Motzkin on neighbourly polytopes.},

	abstract     = {Folklore in complexity theory suspects that circuit lower bounds against {NC}\ensuremath{^1} or P/poly, currently out of reach, are a necessary step towards proving strong proof complexity lower bounds for systems like Frege or Extended Frege. Establishing such a connection formally, however, is already daunting, as it would imply the breakthrough separation {NEXP} \not\subseteq{} P/poly, as recently observed by Pich and Santhanam [Pich and Santhanam, 2023]. We show such a connection conditionally for the Implicit Extended Frege proof system ({iEF}) introduced by Kraj\'{\i}\v{c}ek [Kraj\'{\i}\v{c}ek, 2004], capable of formalizing most of contemporary complexity theory. In particular, we show that if {iEF} proves efficiently the standard derandomization assumption that a concrete Boolean function is hard on average for subexponential-size circuits, then any superpolynomial lower bound on the length of {iEF} proofs implies \#P \not\subseteq{} {FP}/poly (which would in turn imply, for example, {PSPACE} \not\subseteq{} P/poly). Our proof exploits the formalization inside {iEF} of the soundness of the sum-check protocol of Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, and Nisan [Lund et al., 1992]. This has consequences for the self-provability of circuit upper bounds in {iEF}. Interestingly, further improving our result seems to require progress in constructing interactive proof systems with more efficient provers.},
