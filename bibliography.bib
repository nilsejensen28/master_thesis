	abstract = {Total {NP} search problems ({TFNP} problems) typically have their totality guaranteed by some combinatorial property. This paper proves that, if there is a polynomial time Turing reduction between two {TFNP} problems, then there are quasipolynomial size, polylogarithmic height, constant depth, free-cut free propositional (Frege) proofs of the combinatorial property associated with the first {TFNP} problem from the property associated with the second problem. In addition, they have Nullstellensatz derivations of polylogarithmic degree. These results extend the previous work of Buresh-Oppenheim and Morioka first by applying to Turing reductions in place of many-one reductions and second by giving tight bounds on the height of the Frege proofs. As a corollary, {PLScomplete} problems are not polynomial time Turing reducible to {PPA} problems relative to a generic oracle. We establish a converse construction as well, by showing that a polynomial time Turing reduction can be obtained from a family of quasipolynomial size, polylogarithmic depth, propositional proofs which are based on ‘‘decision tree’’ substitutions. This establishes the optimality of our constructions, and partially resolves an open question posed by Buresh-Oppenheim and Morioka.},

	abstract = {The use of monotonicity and Tarski’s theorem in existence proofs of equilibria is very widespread in economics, while Tarski’s theorem is also often used for similar purposes in the context of veriﬁcation. However, there has been relatively little in the way of analysis of the complexity of ﬁnding the ﬁxed points and equilibria guaranteed by this result. We study a computational formalism based on monotone functions on the d-dimensional grid with sides of length N , and their ﬁxed points, as well as the closely connected subject of supermodular games and their equilibria. It is known that ﬁnding some (any) ﬁxed point of a monotone function can be done in time logd N , and we show it requires at least log2 N function evaluations already on the 2-dimensional grid, even for randomized algorithms. We show that the general Tarski problem of ﬁnding some ﬁxed point, when the monotone function is given succinctly (by a boolean circuit), is in the class {PLS} of problems solvable by local search and, rather surprisingly, also in the class {PPAD}. Finding the greatest or least ﬁxed point guaranteed by Tarski’s theorem, however, requires d · N steps, and is {NP}-hard in the white box model. For supermodular games, we show that ﬁnding an equilibrium in such games is essentially computationally equivalent to the Tarski problem, and ﬁnding the maximum or minimum equilibrium is similarly harder. Interestingly, two-player supermodular games where the strategy space of one player is one-dimensional can be solved in O(log N ) steps. We also show that computing (approximating) the value of Condon’s (Shapley’s) stochastic games reduces to the Tarski problem. An important open problem highlighted by this work is proving a Ω(logd N ) lower bound for small ﬁxed dimension d ≥ 3.},

	abstract = {We show {EOPL} = {PLS} ∩ {PPAD}. Here the class {EOPL} consists of all total search problems that reduce to the End-of-Potential-Line problem, which was introduced in the works by Huba´ˇcek and Yogev ({SICOMP} 2020) and Fearnley et al. ({JCSS} 2020). In particular, our result yields a new simpler proof of the breakthrough collapse {CLS} = {PLS} ∩ {PPAD} by Fearnley et al. ({STOC} 2021). We also prove a companion result {SOPL} = {PLS} ∩ {PPADS}, where {SOPL} is the class associated with the Sink-of-Potential-Line problem.},
