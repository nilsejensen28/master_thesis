	abstract = {Total {NP} search problems ({TFNP} problems) typically have their totality guaranteed by some combinatorial property. This paper proves that, if there is a polynomial time Turing reduction between two {TFNP} problems, then there are quasipolynomial size, polylogarithmic height, constant depth, free-cut free propositional (Frege) proofs of the combinatorial property associated with the first {TFNP} problem from the property associated with the second problem. In addition, they have Nullstellensatz derivations of polylogarithmic degree. These results extend the previous work of Buresh-Oppenheim and Morioka first by applying to Turing reductions in place of many-one reductions and second by giving tight bounds on the height of the Frege proofs. As a corollary, {PLScomplete} problems are not polynomial time Turing reducible to {PPA} problems relative to a generic oracle. We establish a converse construction as well, by showing that a polynomial time Turing reduction can be obtained from a family of quasipolynomial size, polylogarithmic depth, propositional proofs which are based on ‘‘decision tree’’ substitutions. This establishes the optimality of our constructions, and partially resolves an open question posed by Buresh-Oppenheim and Morioka.},

	abstract = {The use of monotonicity and Tarski’s theorem in existence proofs of equilibria is very widespread in economics, while Tarski’s theorem is also often used for similar purposes in the context of veriﬁcation. However, there has been relatively little in the way of analysis of the complexity of ﬁnding the ﬁxed points and equilibria guaranteed by this result. We study a computational formalism based on monotone functions on the d-dimensional grid with sides of length N , and their ﬁxed points, as well as the closely connected subject of supermodular games and their equilibria. It is known that ﬁnding some (any) ﬁxed point of a monotone function can be done in time logd N , and we show it requires at least log2 N function evaluations already on the 2-dimensional grid, even for randomized algorithms. We show that the general Tarski problem of ﬁnding some ﬁxed point, when the monotone function is given succinctly (by a boolean circuit), is in the class {PLS} of problems solvable by local search and, rather surprisingly, also in the class {PPAD}. Finding the greatest or least ﬁxed point guaranteed by Tarski’s theorem, however, requires d · N steps, and is {NP}-hard in the white box model. For supermodular games, we show that ﬁnding an equilibrium in such games is essentially computationally equivalent to the Tarski problem, and ﬁnding the maximum or minimum equilibrium is similarly harder. Interestingly, two-player supermodular games where the strategy space of one player is one-dimensional can be solved in O(log N ) steps. We also show that computing (approximating) the value of Condon’s (Shapley’s) stochastic games reduces to the Tarski problem. An important open problem highlighted by this work is proving a Ω(logd N ) lower bound for small ﬁxed dimension d ≥ 3.},

This class captures problems that admit a single combinatorial proof of their joint membership in the complexity classes {PPAD} of ﬁxpoint problems and {PLS} of local search problems. {EOPL} is a combinatorially-deﬁned alternative to the class {CLS} (for Continuous Local Search), which was introduced in [16] with the goal of capturing the complexity of some well-known problems in {PPAD} ∩ {PLS} that have resisted, in some cases for decades, attempts to put them in polynomial time. Two of these are Contraction, the problem of ﬁnding a ﬁxpoint of a contraction map, and P-{LCP}, the problem of solving a P-matrix Linear Complementarity Problem.},
